This project is a modern ecommerce application built with React and TypeScript in RS School.

# Project Description

The ecommerce project uses the latest web technologies to create a fast, responsive shopping platform. With React powering the frontend and TypeScript ensuring type safety throughout the codebase, developers can build and maintain complex features with confidence. The use of Vite for development and production bundling ensures speedy build times and optimal performance.

Key features of the project include:

**Product Catalog**: Browse a wide range of products organized into categories and collections.

**User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization to manage accounts and orders.

**Shopping Cart**: Add and remove items from the shopping cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.

**Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience across devices.
